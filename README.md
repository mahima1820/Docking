# Docking
Docking is the association between the protein and ligand By placing a molecule (ligand) into the preferred binding site of the target specific region of the protein (receptor)  to form a stable complex of potential effectiveness and more specific, molecular docking is performed .  Docking is used for understanding drug biomolecular interactions for rational drug design and discovery, as well as in mechanistic studies. The data from the docking approach can be used to determine the binding energy, free energy, and stability of complexes. Currently, the docking technique is utilised to predict the predicted binding features of the ligand and is very usefull to find the potential lead molecules which could have the drug like properties and can have the potential of being the future drug[mahima_docking_journal.docx]
